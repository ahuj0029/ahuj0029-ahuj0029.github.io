            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
            <p>My name is Raghav Ahuja. I am 21 years old. I am very curious and motivated person who likes learning by doing. I always focus on improving my skills and knowledge. The only reason for taking IMD course because it combines creativity and technology.One of my defining traits is that I am <em>always ready to help others</em> whenever they are in need, whether it is a peer with a difficult assignment or a friend going through a tough time. Additionally, I am a huge dog lover.
            </p>

            <p>When I am not focused on my academic goals, you will almost certainly find me with my headphones on. I love to listen to music of all genres, as it provides both relaxation and the energy I need to stay motivated. Currently, I am a student navigating the challenges of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, expanding my knowledge in various fields, including web development with <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. I am excited to continue learning and growing as I build my future career.
